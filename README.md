# Overview
CK wallet is a community project to create an easy-to-use native application for interacting with cryptokitties smart contracts. Applications and souce code can be used free of charge under MIT licences.

# Design principals
- CK wallet is an open source and open contribution project
- CK wallet is autonomous application and its essential functions should not depend on availability of centralized services or APIs (e.g. api.cryptokitties.co)
- CK wallet provides user interface in form native desktop application. Native application should be able to execute on various platforms (cross-platform). Native application is not resource intensive and should be able to execute effectively on a PC with limited resources.
- CK wallet provides command line interface (cli) to allow task automation and custom scripting
- CK wallet provides reusable API for custom development.

# Roadmap
- v0.1 (initial) - Kitty data synchronization to local database (synchronization worker). Native app mockup.
- v0.2 (TODO) - Auction data synchronization to local database. Native app UI to run simple read queries against database.
- v0.3 (TBD)
- v1.0 - same functional level as CK site
